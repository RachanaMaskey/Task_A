<h2>Technology choices</h2>

-HTML

-CSS

-Javascript

-Swiper.js Library

<h2>Rationale</h2>

The vertical scroll functionality with the coverflow effect adds a dynamic and visually engaging way to navigate content.
The use of breakpoints ensures that the slider works well on various screen sizes and devices.
Leveraging Swiper.js reduces development complexity, as the library provides a wide range of prebuilt functionality.
The gradient background and smooth transitions make the UI appealing.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

-The external CDN links mean the slider won't work offline unless the files are downloaded and hosted locally.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

-Include thumbnails, autoplay functionality, or progress indicators to enhance the user interface.

-Host required assets (e.g., Swiper.js and its CSS) locally or use service workers for better offline performance.
